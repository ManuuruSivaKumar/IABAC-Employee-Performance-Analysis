# IABAC-Employee-Performance-Analysis

INX Future Inc , (referred as INX ) , is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5 years. Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing concerns among the top management.CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further reduce the performance

Insights are expected by this project:
1. Department wise performances
2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees
4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.

5.Random Forest with RandomSearch gives 95% accuracy.

The features that are positively correlated are Environment Satisfaction, Last Salary Hike Percent & Worklife Balance. This means that if these factors increases, Performance Rating will increase. On the other hand, the features that are negatively correlated are Years Since Last Promotion, Experience Years at this Company, Experience years in Current Role & Years with Current Manager. This means that if these factors increases, Performance Rating will go down.

The top 3 features effecting employee performances are:

1.Employee Environment Satisfaction
2.Employee Last Salary Hike Percent
3.Years since last promotion
6.  We can conclude that the company should provide a better environment for the employees as it increases the performance drastically. The company should increase the salary of the employee from time to time and help them maintain a worklife balance. On the other hand, shuffling the manager from time to time will also affect performance.
